<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strand Pelletizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Cut Strand Pelletizer</li><li>Dry Cut Strand Pelletizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Strand pelletizers are used in the plastic processing industry to convert extruded strands into uniform pellets. The wet cut strand pelletizer employs water to cool and cut the strands, resulting in a smooth surface and preventing thermal degradation. In contrast, the dry cut strand pelletizer uses a mechanical cutting system without water, producing dry pellets that have a slightly rougher texture but are often more cost-effective. Both types cater to varying manufacturing needs and material properties in the market.</p></p>
